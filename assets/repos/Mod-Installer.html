<p>With this mod installer, you can install <strong><em>All</em> Optifine, Fabric, Forge and Iris versions and ESSENTIAL</strong>, which are working! <br>
And you can also install my <strong>Client Modpacks</strong> for <strong>1.19.x</strong> and also download some <strong>texture packs!</strong> <br>
In addition, you can save mods in <strong>up to 8 profiles</strong> and start Minecraft via an extra script and directly select the profile that should be loaded. <br>
A <strong>Minecraft Modpack</strong> is supported at least until the next version is stable! <br>
Modpacks always run on the <strong>latest .x version</strong> (for example not on 1.19.1 but alway on the latest Version, on 1.19.2) <br></p>
<p>You can find the latest download <a href="https://github.com/ZoeyVid/Mod-Installer/releases/latest/download/Installer.bat">here</a> <br>
