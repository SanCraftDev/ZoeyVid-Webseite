# [Mod-Installer](https://github.com/ZoeyVid/Mod-Installer)
With this mod installer, you can install **_All_ Optifine, Fabric, Forge and Iris versions and ESSENTIAL**, which are working! <br/>
And you can also install my **Client Modpacks** for **1.19.x** and also download some **texture packs!** <br/>
In addition, you can save mods in **up to 8 profiles** and start Minecraft via an extra script and directly select the profile that should be loaded. <br/>
A **Minecraft Modpack** is supported at least until the next version is stable! <br/>
Modpacks always run on the **latest .x version** (for example not on 1.19.1 but alway on the latest Version, on 1.19.2) <br/>

You can find the latest download [here](https://github.com/ZoeyVid/Mod-Installer/releases/latest/download/Installer.bat) <br/>
